# speed-comparison result storage and visualization

This branch does two things:

1. Extracts the results in a CI run with [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/)
2. Displays the results with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

It uses the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme.
